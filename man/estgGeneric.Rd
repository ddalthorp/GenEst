\title{Generic g estimation for a combination of SE model and CP model
  under a given search schedule}
\usage{
estgGeneric(n = 1, data_SS, model_SE, model_CP, seed_SE = NULL,
  seed_CP = NULL, kFill = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{the number of simulation draws}

\item{data_SS}{Search schedule data as a vector of days searched}

\item{model_SE}{Searcher Efficiency model}

\item{model_CP}{Carcass Persistence model}

\item{seed_SE}{seed for random draws of the SE model}

\item{seed_CP}{seed for random draws of the CP model}

\item{kFill}{value to fill in for missing k when not existing in the model}
}
\value{
gGeneric object that is a list of [1] a list of g estimates,
   with one element in the list corresponding to each of the cells from the 
   cross-model combination and [2] a table of predictors and cell names 
   associated with the gs
}
\description{
The g estimated by \code{estgGeneric} is a generic aggregate detection 
  probability and represents the probability of detecting a carcass that 
  arrives at a (uniform) random time during the period monitored, for each
  of the possible cell combinations, given the SE and CP models. This 
  is somethat different from the GenEst estimation of g when the purpose 
  is to estimate total mortality (M), in which case the detection 
  probability varies with carcass arrival interval and is difficult to 
  summarize statistically. The \code{estgGeneric} estimate is a useful 
  "big picture" summary of detection probability, but would be difficult
  to work with for estimating M with precision.
