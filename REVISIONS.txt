v1.3.3

* corrected a data frame subsetting function that returned a data frame rather
than the expected vector. This was causing a the output matrix for CP model 
fits to be reconstructed as a list, which was causing gray-screen crashes when
CP output to the screen was for models other than the Weibull (GUI only). The
error has been corrected.

* an error in formatting data for displaying tables of summary statistics
for exponential CP models was preventing the tables from appearing under
the "Estimates" tab for CP models in the GUI. This bug has been fixed.

* labels were not properly matched to pk figures in the GUI when there were
two covariates and a fig for a "*" model for p was drawn after a fig for a "+"
model was drawn. Cell labels are now correctly matched to cell figs.

* an error in the function for downloading a comprehensive set of summary 
statistics for estimated mortality (including names of all data sets used, 
names and summary statistics for selected SE and CP models, AIC tables used  
for model selection, summary statistics for M_hat and splits) made it so only
the CP table was downloaded. The error has been corrected so that all the 
intended data is downloaded.

* An error in the calculation of extreme tail probabilities of loglogistic 
persistence distributions has been corrected. This bug would only be a problem
in estimating g (and M) when the CP distribution was loglogistic with very
short persistence times relative to the search intervals. The user would have
seen a cryptic error message when trying to estimate M or a gray screen (GUI)
when trying to estimate g.

* removed the "seed" arguments seed_SE, seed_CP, seed_g, and seed_M, in estg, 
estgGeneric, and estM. The utility of providing these seeds in the arg lists 
would be for minute management of creating strictly reprodicible results in 
command-line analyses. However, this purpose can normally be just as readily 
and more safely accomplished by management of seeds outside the function calls, 
as, e.g., set.seed(1234); estM(...) rather than estM(..., seed = 1234). In 
addition, ensuring that the internal seeds maintain their expected behavior 
after software updates unnecessarily complicates GenEst code maintenance.

* the old plot.gGeneric function determined covariate cells by parsing the 
short form cell names by splitting the names by ".". This precludes having "."
in the name of any covariate level. No other functions have this restriction.
The new plot.gGeneric extracts the cells from x$predictors rather than parsing
concatenated cell names.

* SE figures have been amended to correct several problems:
-- labels for cellwise plots showing summaries of data and fitted models have
   been corrected (under certain combinations of selected p and k formulas 
   with 2 predictors, some of the labels were incorrect)
-- illegibly small font sizes have been increased
-- figures produced from command-line using plot.pkm have been prettified
-- labels for cellwise p and k summaries and summaries of data with fitted 
   values were changed from cell names in the panel corners to margin labels
   that show both the predictor name and the levels
-- the superfluous "app" arg in plot.pkm and plot.pkmSet has been removed
-- functions plotSEFigure, pkmParamPlot, pkmSECellPlot, plotSEHeader, 
   plotSEBoxPlots, pkmSetSpecParamPlot, plotSEBoxTemplate, plotSECells, 
   pkmSetSpecSECellPlot, and SEcols have been replaced with a modified version
   of plotSEFigure, which calls two new functions (SEpanel and SEboxes) that
   are not exported but called by plot.pkm and plot.pkmSet

* added pda & pdb and location & scale to the download file for CP (GUI)

* in the $cell_ab table of descriptive stastistics for CP models with
loglogistic or Weibull distributions, the lower and upper bounds of the CIs
for the pda parameter were transposed (in cpm objects on the command-line). 
The error has been corrected.
* an internal database (sysdata.rda) of parameters used by the GUI has been 
created to store, e.g., default colors and other graphics settings.

* quantiles of the marginal distributions of p_hat and k_hat were calculated 
by simulation, which is slow and relatively inaccurate; v1.3.3 introduces a 
new function "qpk" to return the quantiles directly from the estimated means
and variances that were previously used to simulate data for calculating the 
quantiles empirically from the simulated data.

* functions that are only used internally are no longer exported, following 
suggestion in Wickham (2015) [http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/namespace.html]


* An error in array indexing for the "2n fix" (added in v1.3.1) to allow 
estimation of searcher efficiency when all SE trial carcasses in a cell are 
either found or not found on the first search essentially nullified the fix
in most cases. Data sets that require the "2n fix" are not common, and the 
error would be limited to scenarios where formula_p has 1 predictor and an 
offending cell that is not the first cell in the data or formula_p has is
the interaction model with an offending cell that is not the first cell in
the data and the GenEst version is v1.3.1 or v1.3.2. Earlier versions would 
throw an error and abort the calculation rather than apply the "2n fix". The
error has been corrected in development version v1.3.3.1 and all subsequent
production versions (>=1.3.3). 

2019.09.13
v1.3.2

* correction of bug that incorrectly caused a pk model error when all carcasses
were either found or not found on the first search in SE field trials with no
covariates (GUI and command line). 

* correction of bug in error-checking for carcass ID column selection (GUI).
GUI users may notice better software stability in the "Estimate" button under 
the "Mortality Estimation" tab.

* removed dependency on cbinom and removed supporting functions for cbinom 
because we no longer use cbinom

* changed output table for CP model summary to show point estimates and CIs for
medianCP and r statistics rather than showing point estimates and CIs for 
location and scale parameters and just point estimates for medianCP and r 
statistics (GUI)

* added a function [desc(model_CP,...)] to calculate medianCP and r statistics 
(with CIs) for user-specified intervals (command-line). This function is used 
internally in the GUI for producing display tables for CP models.

* simplified the code flow for writing CP summary tables:
(1) eliminated the superfluous data structures rv$modTabPretty_CP and 
rv$modTabDL_CP, instead storing the table of summary statistics for a selected 
CP model in rv$modTab_CP. Previously, there were three extremely similar sets of 
data stored under different names. Now there is only one.
(2) create "pretty" data table for GUI rendering in one function call and only
when needed

* removed the function "renderDTns", which simply called an existing function 
[renderDataTable(...)] with arg "server = FALSE" and was superfluous.

* added DT:: prefixes to calls to renderDataTable to disambiguate the functions
in 'shiny' and 'DT'

* other superfluous functions were removed: trueLength, isNeverDecreasing, 
Ecbinom, cbmean, DWPbyCarcass

* the .rda was removed because it had data strictly for processing cbinom bias
corrections

* corrected an error that led to omission of the $n column in the $cell_ab table
in cpm objects that were fit with scale parameter modeled as an additive
function of two predictors or a function of more than two predictors. 

* changed the display and help name for "size" to "class" to reflect broader
interpretation of carcass types beyond just size. In the underlying code, the 
word "size" is preserved to maintain robustness and to be compatible with legacy
code that command-line users may have developed for analyses or explorations.

* changed pk model summary statistics output table to show only 3 digits instead
of 6 (GUI).

* moved the cell names from the first column of the descriptive statistics for 
CP model into the row names instead. This makes it easier to work with the data
sets because they are all numeric rather than being a mix of names and numeric.

v1.3.1

* adjustment to pk models to allow fitting in the uncommon scenarios where all
field trial carcasses are found are are missed in a cell. Data from offending
cells are duplicated but with one carcass having opposite fate from the others.
Result is that p_hat in the offending cell = 1/(2n), with variance structure
that closely approximates a Bayesian posterior of p based on p ~ beta with a 
uniform prior. The revised pk model is identical to the previous version except
that it as adapted to fitting a wider array of data scenarios.

* simple correction to reset kFixed to null when a pk model is cleared (GUI).

* replaced the bias-corrected cbinom(x/g, g) bootstrap for xtilde with the more 
efficient bias-corrected binom(round(x/g), g) bootstrap. Users are unlikely to
notice any differences in results but will notice faster computation times
for the estimating M.

2019.07.17
v1.3.0

* more informative data downloads with more useful default file names (GUI)

* option to plot multiple 'splits' graphics panels on common y-axis scale (GUI)

* unique carcass ID used as row names in the Mhat element of estM objects. 
This will help facilitate the performing of complicated, custom mortality splits
from the command-line.

* new placeholder functions for accommodating the incorporation of a DWP 
module sometime in the not-to-distant future. Currently, the only function
available is a null model that simply reads DWP data that was generated outside
GenEst. The models (including the null model) can accomodate uncertainties
in the estimation of DWP.

2019.04.12
v1.2.4

* an error in extracting data from splits arrays for Mhat resulted in boxplots
that were constructed from plot.splitSummary (or the "Split Estimate" button in
the GUI) having lower tails that were too long and having all other quantiles 
shifted slightly downward. The error has been corrected. Users may notice the
change in the lengths of the lower tails in the splits plots.

* corrected the lower bound of the CIs shown on the histogram for Mhat 
estimates so that it cannot exceed the number of carcasses observed after the
first search

* minor editing of some GUI labels and messages to improve readability

2019.03.07
v1.2.3

* added a error check to return a more meaningful message when there are 
mismatches between covariate levels in CO and SE or CP. 
Previously: "subscript out of bounds"
Now: The offending data formatting error is identified and referenced 
specifically and clearly in an error message.

* extended the KM lines on the CP figs in cases where there are many
right-censored data points.

* an error in loop indexing in the error-checking routine for identifying the
"unit" column inadvertently required that in cases where there were two or more
column names in common between the CO and DWP files, the unit column in the CO
file had to be one of the first few columns; otherwise, an error message was 
generated and the mortality calculation could not be completed. The error has
been corrected.

None of the changes affect analyses or results but all will improve user 
experience with the software.

2019.02.04
v1.2.2

* added a note for Windows users about downloading example data sets.

* with data sets with only 1 unit, prepSS was not properly assigning unit
names to rows of searches_unit array. This caused an error in prepSS and its
dependencies (estM and estg), which was expressed in the error message: 
"no 'dimnames' attribute for array". This has been corrected.

* corrected the download button for figures showing transposed mortality 
splits (previously, the untransposed figs were downloaded)

* corrected an error in calculating average SS under certain conditions,
the error affected default values in a convenience funtion and had
zero potential for producing erroneous or misleading results but would 
require users to enter specific values into a input box for which reasonable
default values should have been made available.

2018.12.09
v1.2.1

* changed the conditional run_M and run_g buttons to use output.filename_SS
rather than output.data_SS as a check. The check on output.data_SS required
users who uploaded example data into the GUI to click on the "Search Schedule"
panel before the run_M and run_g buttons could be activated. This change
relieves an inconvenience that GUI users would have when analyzing the example
data sets (GUI).

* corrected a check on data structure that was preventing estimation of 
mortality in some very simple data sets, namely, data with no carcass size
distinctions, only one search occasion represented in the SE data, and using 
a fixed k parameter (GUI). 

* fixed a bug that was preventing mortality estimation in cases where there 
was more than one size class and more than one estimate of mortality was to 
be made in succession (GUI). 

* streamlined the interface under the "Detection Probability" tab by removing 
the requirement that, after entering new search schedule parameters, users must
calculate the new search schedule derived from the parameters before clicking 
"Estimate" to get the new g's based on the new search schedule. Also, added the
search schedule to the results table's caption to make it clear which search 
parameters the g_hat's are associated with (GUI). 

* the default search schedule that is entered into the numericInput boxes under
the "Detection Probability" calculation tab is now NULL when no data_SS is 
loaded and averageSS when a data_SS is loaded. The new defaults are a better 
representation (averageSS) of the uploaded data than are the previous
one-size-fits-all parameters of I = 7, span = 364. However, the "Detection 
Probability" tab SS parameters are not used in mortality estimation and are 
strictly a user convenience for data exploration and can be readily changed 
with no downstream consequences on results outside the specialized "Detection
Probability" page (GUI).

* two-dimensional transposeSplits was assigning some splits estimates to the 
wrong splits levels because of an array ordering issue. This has been corrected
by initial ordering of CO splits in calcSplits. (command line and GUI)

* added additional error-checks for failure to select CP and SE models for all
size classes. Previously, if models were selected for the first size class but
no others, the "Estimate" buttons were activated for both M and genericg, but
clicking them would crash GenEst (gray screen). Now, the buttons are still 
activated, but a new error-check catches the problem and displays a useful
error message in lieu of crashing. (GUI)

* added code to convert dataframe "factors" to "characters" prior to performing
calculations in pkm0, cpm0, estM, estg, 

* figure downloaded for estimated mortality corrected to properly reflect user's
custom-selected CL

2018.12.06
v1.2.0

* updated the .zip download buttons to no longer require an unzip utility to
be in the path statement in Windows (using zip::zip rather than utils::zip). 

* more robust error-checking and more informative error messages. Changes
affect especially the functions under the "Mortality Estimation" in the GUI, 
which have the most demanding data formatting requirements.

* corrected the mortality splits results summary table to sort mortality
quantiles numerically rather than alphabetically.

* removed the requirement that GUI users both enter a value for fixedK and
check a box indicating that a value is entered. User simply enters a value
for fixedK or leaves the field blank, whichever is appropriate for the 
desired analysis.

2018.11.23
v1.1.3

* improved error-checking and error messages for auto-parsing of CO, SS, and
DWP files to find unit column when not provided by user in arg list to
estg or estM. The error-checking is extracted into a short function that is 
called by estg and estM when necessary.

2018.11.22
v1.1.2

* example data sets can now be loaded directly into the GUI from buttons on
the (newly named "Example Data" tab...formerly "Downloads") rather than
requiring that they be first downloaded as .csv files and then uploaded
one by one into the GUI. (The data sets can still be downloaded for use
as input file templates or other purposes if desired.)

* improved error-checking and error messages for estM function

* export the more informative estM error messages from command line function
to the GUI

* updated links to User Guide and technical manual to point to doi's rather
than pdf's

2018.11.19
v1.1.1

* estg: error-check added for carcasses discovered before searches begin

* estM: error-check added for CO units not included in DWP

* cpm0: sample size was missing from cp model tables when s parameter has an
additive model (e.g., s ~ A + B). Fixed

2018.11.14
v1.1.0

* added links to published GenEst User Guide and GenEst Statistical Models

* corrected a GUI bug that prevented mortality estimation when CO and DWP files
had more than one column name in common

* corrected a GUI bug that caused intermittent failure to update some results
figs when user selected new models. The bug was caused by figs sometimes not
being properly suspended when hidden.

* corrected a bug that caused ppersist to return NaN or 0 for Weibull 
distributed persistence times when the variance of the scale parameter was very
large. The error occured when all CP field trial carcasses were removed in the
span of two intervals. Improved error-checking and an updated calculation of 
Weibull ppersist for data that generates fits with very large uncertainty in
scale parameter.

* corrected a GUI bug that erroneously allowed the drop-down selection menus for
mortality splits to permit more than two covariates to be selected in certain
cases where an improper model was first entered, later corrected, and then a 
third covariate selected from the temporal splits menu. Results figures and 
tables would show the proper covariates, but they would not be properly 
reflected in the drop-downs. This was due to an error in the conditionals for
the drop-down lists not being properly updated. It had no effect on calculations
or results.

* GUI code was revised for readability and easier maintenance: some groups of
very small functions were consolidated into larger functions, overly long 
variable names were shortened, some groups of short files were consolidated into
longer files. 

* Documentation for GUI code was updated to facilitate code maintenance.
