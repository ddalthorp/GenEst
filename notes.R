currently working through this whole business to tidy the flonk out of
the server code

developing the eventReaction function to be a general purpose function that
is called from the server script and implements the lower level functions

worked through the data loading and all clearing functions

worked through the SE column selection and the size column selection for SE



to do

generalize the message functions

figure out how to handle the situation where functions aren't needed
  in the long term, that'll be not an issue
  in the short term, we can use exists() to check if the function exists and
    only call if it does

functioned out the server script like the UI one

tidy the fuck outta the functions lower down
