Revision log

v1.3.1

* adjustment to pk models to allow fitting in the uncommon scenarios where all
field trial carcasses are found are are missed in a cell. Data from offending
cells are duplicated but with one carcass having opposite fate from the others.
Result is that p_hat in the offending cell = 1/(2n), with variance structure
that closely approximates a Bayesian posterior of p based on p ~ beta with a 
uniform prior. The revised pk model is identical to the previous version except
that it as adapted to fitting a wider array of data scenarios.

* simple correction to reset kFixed to null when a pk model is cleared (GUI).

* replaced the bias-corrected cbinom(x/g, g) bootstrap for xtilde with the more 
efficient bias-corrected binom(round(x/g), g) bootstrap. Users are unlikely to
notice any differences in results but will notice faster computation times
for the estimating M.

2019.07.17
v1.3.0

* more informative data downloads with more useful default file names (GUI)

* option to plot multiple 'splits' graphics panels on common y-axis scale (GUI)

* unique carcass ID used as row names in the Mhat element of estM objects. 
This will help facilitate the performing of complicated, custom mortality splits
from the command-line.

* new placeholder functions for accommodating the incorporation of a DWP 
module sometime in the not-to-distant future. Currently, the only function
available is a null model that simply reads DWP data that was generated outside
GenEst. The models (including the null model) can accomodate uncertainties
in the estimation of DWP.

2019.04.12
v1.2.4

* an error in extracting data from splits arrays for Mhat resulted in boxplots
that were constructed from plot.splitSummary (or the "Split Estimate" button in
the GUI) having lower tails that were too long and having all other quantiles 
shifted slightly downward. The error has been corrected. Users may notice the
change in the lengths of the lower tails in the splits plots.

* corrected the lower bound of the CIs shown on the histogram for Mhat 
estimates so that it cannot exceed the number of carcasses observed after the
first search

* minor editing of some GUI labels and messages to improve readability

2019.03.07
v1.2.3

* added a error check to return a more meaningful message when there are 
mismatches between covariate levels in CO and SE or CP. 
Previously: "subscript out of bounds"
Now: The offending data formatting error is identified and referenced 
specifically and clearly in an error message.

* extended the KM lines on the CP figs in cases where there are many
right-censored data points.

* an error in loop indexing in the error-checking routine for identifying the
"unit" column inadvertently required that in cases where there were two or more
column names in common between the CO and DWP files, the unit column in the CO
file had to be one of the first few columns; otherwise, an error message was 
generated and the mortality calculation could not be completed. The error has
been corrected.

None of the changes affect analyses or results but all will improve user 
experience with the software.

2019.02.04
v1.2.2

* added a note for Windows users about downloading example data sets.

* with data sets with only 1 unit, prepSS was not properly assigning unit
names to rows of searches_unit array. This caused an error in prepSS and its
dependencies (estM and estg), which was expressed in the error message: 
"no 'dimnames' attribute for array". This has been corrected.

* corrected the download button for figures showing transposed mortality 
splits (previously, the untransposed figs were downloaded)

* corrected an error in calculating average SS under certain conditions,
the error affected default values in a convenience funtion and had
zero potential for producing erroneous or misleading results but would 
require users to enter specific values into a input box for which reasonable
default values should have been made available.

2018.12.09
v1.2.1

* changed the conditional run_M and run_g buttons to use output.filename_SS
rather than output.data_SS as a check. The check on output.data_SS required
users who uploaded example data into the GUI to click on the "Search Schedule"
panel before the run_M and run_g buttons could be activated. This change
relieves an inconvenience that GUI users would have when analyzing the example
data sets (GUI).

* corrected a check on data structure that was preventing estimation of 
mortality in some very simple data sets, namely, data with no carcass size
distinctions, only one search occasion represented in the SE data, and using 
a fixed k parameter (GUI). 

* fixed a bug that was preventing mortality estimation in cases where there 
was more than one size class and more than one estimate of mortality was to 
be made in succession (GUI). 

* streamlined the interface under the "Detection Probability" tab by removing 
the requirement that, after entering new search schedule parameters, users must
calculate the new search schedule derived from the parameters before clicking 
"Estimate" to get the new g's based on the new search schedule. Also, added the
search schedule to the results table's caption to make it clear which search 
parameters the g_hat's are associated with (GUI). 

* the default search schedule that is entered into the numericInput boxes under
the "Detection Probability" calculation tab is now NULL when no data_SS is 
loaded and averageSS when a data_SS is loaded. The new defaults are a better 
representation (averageSS) of the uploaded data than are the previous
one-size-fits-all parameters of I = 7, span = 364. However, the "Detection 
Probability" tab SS parameters are not used in mortality estimation and are 
strictly a user convenience for data exploration and can be readily changed 
with no downstream consequences on results outside the specialized "Detection
Probability" page (GUI).

* two-dimensional transposeSplits was assigning some splits estimates to the 
wrong splits levels because of an array ordering issue. This has been corrected
by initial ordering of CO splits in calcSplits. (command line and GUI)

* added additional error-checks for failure to select CP and SE models for all
size classes. Previously, if models were selected for the first size class but
no others, the "Estimate" buttons were activated for both M and genericg, but
clicking them would crash GenEst (gray screen). Now, the buttons are still 
activated, but a new error-check catches the problem and displays a useful
error message in lieu of crashing. (GUI)

* added code to convert dataframe "factors" to "characters" prior to performing
calculations in pkm0, cpm0, estM, estg, 

* figure downloaded for estimated mortality corrected to properly reflect user's
custom-selected CL

2018.12.06
v1.2.0

* updated the .zip download buttons to no longer require an unzip utility to
be in the path statement in Windows (using zip::zip rather than utils::zip). 

* more robust error-checking and more informative error messages. Changes
affect especially the functions under the "Mortality Estimation" in the GUI, 
which have the most demanding data formatting requirements.

* corrected the mortality splits results summary table to sort mortality
quantiles numerically rather than alphabetically.

* removed the requirement that GUI users both enter a value for fixedK and
check a box indicating that a value is entered. User simply enters a value
for fixedK or leaves the field blank, whichever is appropriate for the 
desired analysis.

2018.11.23
v1.1.3

* improved error-checking and error messages for auto-parsing of CO, SS, and
DWP files to find unit column when not provided by user in arg list to
estg or estM. The error-checking is extracted into a short function that is 
called by estg and estM when necessary.

2018.11.22
v1.1.2

* example data sets can now be loaded directly into the GUI from buttons on
the (newly named "Example Data" tab...formerly "Downloads") rather than
requiring that they be first downloaded as .csv files and then uploaded
one by one into the GUI. (The data sets can still be downloaded for use
as input file templates or other purposes if desired.)

* improved error-checking and error messages for estM function

* export the more informative estM error messages from command line function
to the GUI

* updated links to User Guide and technical manual to point to doi's rather
than pdf's

2018.11.19
v1.1.1

* estg: error-check added for carcasses discovered before searches begin

* estM: error-check added for CO units not included in DWP

* cpm0: sample size was missing from cp model tables when s parameter has an
additive model (e.g., s ~ A + B). Fixed

2018.11.14
v1.1.0

* added links to published GenEst User Guide and GenEst Statistical Models

* corrected a GUI bug that prevented mortality estimation when CO and DWP files
had more than one column name in common

* corrected a GUI bug that caused intermittent failure to update some results
figs when user selected new models. The bug was caused by figs sometimes not
being properly suspended when hidden.

* corrected a bug that caused ppersist to return NaN or 0 for Weibull 
distributed persistence times when the variance of the scale parameter was very
large. The error occured when all CP field trial carcasses were removed in the
span of two intervals. Improved error-checking and an updated calculation of 
Weibull ppersist for data that generates fits with very large uncertainty in
scale parameter.

* corrected a GUI bug that erroneously allowed the drop-down selection menus for
mortality splits to permit more than two covariates to be selected in certain
cases where an improper model was first entered, later corrected, and then a 
third covariate selected from the temporal splits menu. Results figures and 
tables would show the proper covariates, but they would not be properly 
reflected in the drop-downs. This was due to an error in the conditionals for
the drop-down lists not being properly updated. It had no effect on calculations
or results.

* GUI code was revised for readability and easier maintenance: some groups of
very small functions were consolidated into larger functions, overly long 
variable names were shortened, some groups of short files were consolidated into
longer files. 

* Documentation for GUI code was updated to facilitate code maintenance.
