\title{Fit all possible searcher efficiency models across all size classes}
\usage{
pkmSetSize(formula_p, formula_k = NULL, data, obsCol = NULL,
  sizeclassCol = NULL, kFixed = NULL, kInit = 0.7, CL = 0.95,
  quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_p}{Formula for p; an object of class "\code{\link{formula}}"
(or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of
the model to be fitted. Details of model specification are given under 
"Details".}

\item{formula_k}{Formula for k; an object of class "\code{\link{formula}}"
(or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of 
the model to be fitted. Details of model specification are given under 
"Details".}

\item{data}{Dataframe with results from searcher efficiency trials and any
covariates included in \code{formula_p} or {formula_k} (required).}

\item{obsCol}{Vector of names of columns in \code{data} where results 
for each search occasion are stored (optional). If no \code{obsCol} are 
provided, \code{pkm} uses as \code{obsCol} all columns with names that 
begin with an \code{"s"} or \code{"S"} and end with a number, e.g., 
"s1", "s2", "s3", etc. This option is included as a convenience for the 
user, but care must be taken that other data are not stored in columns 
with names matching that pattern. Alternatively, \code{obsCol} may be 
entered as a vector of names, like \code{c("s1", "s2", "s3")}, 
\code{paste0("s", 1:3)}, or \code{c("initialSearch", "anotherSearch", 
"lastSearch")}.}

\item{sizeclassCol}{Name of colum in \code{data} where the size classes
are recorded}

\item{kFixed}{Parameters (vector) for user-specified fixed \code{k} values
(optional). Class names must be provided for each class that is to have
a \code{kFixed} value associated with it. For classes that are unnamed in
the \code{kFixed} vector, \code{k} will be fit using \code{pkm}. If
\code{kFixed} is an unnamed scalar, then \code{k} is assumed fixed at
\code{kFixed} for all size classes.}

\item{kInit}{Initial value used for \code{k} in the optimization.}

\item{CL}{confidence level}

\item{quiet}{Logical indicator of whether or not to print messsages}
}
\value{
\code{pkmSetSize} returns a class-\code{pkmSetSize} list of 
  objects, each of which is a class-\code{pkmSet} list of \code{pkm}" 
  outputs (each corresponding to the fit of a specific model
  within the set of \code{pkm} models fit for the given size class), that
  is of length equal to the total number of size classes
}
\description{
Run a set of \code{\link{pkmSet}} model set runs based on all
  possible models for a suite of size classes. \code{cpmSetSize}'s inputs
  generally follow \code{\link{pkmSet}} and \code{\link{pkm}} but with an 
  additional size column input and calculation of the set of cpm models 
  for each of the size classes.

\examples{
  data(wind_RP)
  mod <- pkmSetSize(formula_p = p ~ Season, formula_k = k ~ Season, 
           data = wind_RP$SE, sizeclassCol = "Size"
          )
