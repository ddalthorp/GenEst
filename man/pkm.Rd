\usage{
pkm(formula_p, formula_k = NULL, data, obsCol = NULL, kFixed = NULL,
  kInit = 0.7, CL = 0.95, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{formula_p}{Formula for p; an object of class "\code{\link{formula}}"
(or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of 
the model to be fitted. Details of model specification are given under 
"Details".}

\item{formula_k}{Formula for k; an object of class "\code{\link{formula}}"
(or one that can be coerced to that class): a symbolic description of the
model to be fitted. Details of model specification are given under 
"Details".}

\item{data}{Dataframe with results from searcher efficiency trials and any
covariates included in \code{formula_p} or {formula_k} (required).}

\item{obsCol}{Vector of names of columns in \code{data} where results 
for each search occasion are stored (optional). If no \code{obsCol} are 
provided, \code{pkm} uses as \code{obsCol} all columns with names that 
begin with an \code{"s"} or \code{"S"} and end with a number, e.g., "s1",
"s2", "s3", etc. This option is included as a convenience for the user, 
but care must be taken that other data are not stored in columns with 
names matching that pattern. Alternatively, \code{obsCol} may be 
entered as a vector of names, like \code{c("s1", "s2", "s3")}, 
\code{paste0("s", 1:3)}, or \code{c("initialSearch", "anotherSearch", 
"lastSearch")}.}

\item{kFixed}{Parameter for user-specified \code{k} value (optional). If a
value is provided, \code{formula_k} is ignored and the model is fit under
the assumption that the \code{k} parameter is fixed and known to be
\code{kFixed}.}

\item{kInit}{Initial value used for numerical optimization of \code{k}.}

\item{CL}{confidence level}

\item{quiet}{Logical indicator of whether or not to print messsages}
}
\value{
\code{pkm} returns an object of class "\code{pkm}", which is a list
  whose components characterize the fit of the model. Due to the large
  number and complexity of components, only a subset of them is printed 
  automatically; the rest can be viewed/accessed directly via the \code{$}
 operator if desired.

The following components are displayed automatically:

\describe{
 \item{\code{call}}{the function call to fit the model}
  \item{\code{formula_p}}{the model formula for the \code{p} parameter}
  \item{\code{formula_k}}{the model formula for the \code{k} parameter}
 \item{\code{predictors}}{list of covariates of \code{p} and/or \code{k}}
 \item{\code{cellwiseTable}}{summary statistics for estimated cellwise 
   \code{p} and \code{k}, including the medians and upper & lower bounds
   on CIs for each parameter, indexed by cell (or combination of
   covariate levels).}
 \item{\code{AICc}}{the AIC value as corrected for small sample size}
 \item{\code{convergence}}{convergence status of the numerical optimization
   to find the maximum likelihood estimates of \code{p} and \code{k}. A 
   value of \code{0} indicates that the model was fit successfully. For 
   help in deciphering other values, see \code{\link{optim}}.}

The following components are not printed automatically but can be accessed
via the \code{$} operator:
\describe{
 \item{\code{data}}{the data used to fit the model}
  \item{\code{betahat_p}}{parameter estimates for the terms in the 
    regression model for for \code{p} (logit scale)}
  \item{\code{betahat_k}}{parameter estimates for the terms in the 
    regression model for for \code{k} (logit scale). If \code{k} is fixed 
    and known, \code{betahat_k} is not calculated.}
  \item{\code{varbeta}}{the variance-covariance matrix of the estimators
    for \code{c(betahat_p, betahat_k}.}
  \item{\code{cellMM_p}}{a cellwise model (design) matrix for covariate 
    structure of \code{p_formula}}

    \code{covar1} has levels \code{"a"}, \code{"b"}, and \code{"c"}, and
    \code{covar2} has levels \code{"X"} and \code{"Y"}, then the cells

\description{
Searcher efficiency is modeled as a function of the number of
  times a  carcass has been missed in previous searches and any number of 
  such as covariates. Format and usage parallel that of common \code{R} 
  functions \code{lm}, \code{glm}, and \code{gam}. However, the input data 
  (\code{data}) is structured differently to accommodate the 
  multiple-search searcher efficiency trials (see 'Details'), and model 
  formulas may be entered for both \code{p} (akin to an intercept) and  
  \code{k} (akin to aslope).
}
\details{
The probability of finding a carcass that is present at the time of search
  is \code{p} on the first search after carcass arrival and is assumed to
  decrease by a factor of \code{k} each time the carcass is missed in 
  searches. Both \code{p} and \code{k} may depend on covariates such as 
  ground cover, season, species, etc., and a separate model format 
  (\code{formula_p} and \code{formula_k}) may be entered for each. The 
  models are entered as they would be in the familiar \code{lm} or 
  \code{glm} functions in R. For example, \code{p} might vary with
  \code{visibility}, \code{season}, and \code{site}, while \code{k} varies
  only with \code{visibility}. A user might then enter \code{p ~ visibility
  + season + site} for \code{formula_p} and \code{k ~ visibility} for 
  \code{formula_k}. Other R conventions for defining formulas may also be 
  used, with \code{covar1:covar2} for the interaction between covariates 
  1 and 2 and \code{covar1 * covar2} as short-hand for \code{covar1 +
  covar2 + covar1:covar2}.

Search trial \code{data} must be entered in a data frame with data in 
  each row giving the fate of a single carcass in the field trials. There
  must be a column for each search occassion, with 0, 1, or NA depending on
  whether the carcass was missed, found, or not available (typically 
  because it was found and removed on a previous search, had been earlier
  removed by  scavengers, or was not searched for) on the given search  
  occasion. Additional columns with values for categorical covariates  
  (e.g., visibility = E, M, or D) may also be included.
