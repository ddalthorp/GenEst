## Introduction: Tutorial with Examples
This tutorial provides an introduction to the array of command line tools
**GenEst** provides for estimating carcass arrivals and detection
probabilities. The approach is to walk through analyses of realistic but 
fictitious data sets representing studies of bird and bat mortality at a
wind power facility.

The general steps in the analysis are:

1. Construct a model for Searcher Efficiency
2. Construct a model for Carcass Persistance
3. Estimate mortality
4. Specify the type of summary desired (e.g., mortality by species and season)

Data required for a full analysis include results of searcher efficiency trials,
results of carcass persistence trials, search schedules for all units searched,
the search coverage within each unit, and results of periodic carcass surveys.
More information about the kinds of data required can be found in Appendix A.
Example data sets are located in folders in `...GenEst\inst\extdata\`. For
convenience, data required in this tutorial are available in R as packaged lists,
which can readily be loaded as described below.

To perform the analyses illustrated in the tutorial, begin by starting R and
loading GenEst from the command line: `library(GenEst)`

## Example 1: Estimating Bat Mortality from Searches on Roads and Pads
Searcher efficiency and carcass persistence would be expected to vary with
carcass size (sparrow, eagle, bat), ground characteristics (road & pad,
cleared field, vegetation type), season, etc. In this first example, we limit
the analysis to one carcass size (`bat`) and one ground visibility class
(`RP` = road and pad). A more complicated scenario is analyzed in example 2.

The required data is stored in `wind_RPbat`, a list of data frames with results
for searcher efficiency (`SE`) and carcass persistence trials (`CP`), search
schedules for all turbines (`SS`), the search coverage or density weighted
proportion (`DWP`) of area searched at each turbine (i.e., the fraction of
carcasses expected to fall in the search plots), and carcass observation (`CO`)
data.

Load the full data set into R:
```{r}
data(wind_RPbat)
names(wind_RPbat)
```
To streamline the notation, extract the data from the `wind_RPbat` list into its
components:
```{r}
data_SE <- wind_RPbat$SE
data_CP <- wind_RPbat$CP
data_SS <- wind_RPbat$SS
data_DWP <- wind_RPbat$DWP
data_CO <- wind_RPbat$CO
```

```{r, include = FALSE}
daterange <- range(data_SS$SearchDate)
seasons <- paste(unique(data_SS$Season), collapse = ', ')
```
### Searcher Efficiency (`SE`)
Searcher efficiency trials were conducted on roads and pads, with a total of
`r  dim(data_SE)[1]` fresh carcasses placed in the field over the course of
the entire monitoring period, evenly divided among seasons (`r seasons`). 
Carcasses that were later discovered by search teams during the course of 
normal carcass surveys were removed from the field. Carcasses were left in 
the field for up to 5 searches after carcass placement.

Results of the SE field trials are stored in the `data_SE` data frame:
```{r}
head(data_SE)
```
Columns `s1, s2, ..., s5` show the fate of carcass `pkID` on the 1st, 2nd, ...
5th searches after the carcass was placed. A 1 indicates that the carcass was
discovered, a 0 indicates that the carcass was present but not discovered, and
NA indicates that the carcass was no longer present for discovery or no search
was conducted.

### Carcass Persistence (`CP`)
Carcass persistence trials were conducted on roads and pads, with a total of
`r  dim(data_CP)[1]` fresh carcasses placed in the field over the course of
the entire monitoring period, evenly divided among seasons (`r seasons`). 
Carcasses were checked approximately 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28
days after placement in the field. Exact times were entered as decimal
fractions of days after placement.

Results of the SE field trials are stored in the `data_CP` data frame:
```{r}
head(data_CP)
```

Exact persistence times are not known, but a carcass that was present at one
check and absent at the next check is assumed to have been removed at some
point in the interval. The left endpoint of the interval was entered as `LastPresent`
and the right endpoint as `FirstAbsent`. For carcasses that had not been scavenged
by the end of the study, `LastPresent` is the time of the last check and `FirstAbsent`
is `Inf`. For carcasses whose removal time is known exactly (e.g., scavenging
was recorded by camera), `LastPresent = FirstAbsent`. The `Season` column gives the season at
the time the carcass was placed in the field.

### Search Schedules (`SS`)
Carcass searches were conducted on roads and pads within a 120 m radius from 
all `r length(unique(data_SS$SearchDate))` turbines at a fictitious wind power
facility. Monitoring began on `r daterange[1]` and continued through
`r daterange[2]`. Searches spanned `r length(unique(data_SS$Season))` seasons:
`r seasons`. Search intervals varied by turbine and by time of year, ranging 
from daily searches at some turbines in the fall and searches once every 12 
days in the spring at some other turbines. Search schedules for all turbines 
are stored in `data_SS`, which is a data frame with a column for search dates
(including all dates that any turbine was searched); a column of 0s and 1s for 
each turbine, indication whether it was searched on the given date; and zero 
or more optional columns giving additional information about the date (e.g.,
season).

```{r}
head(data_SS[, 1:10])
```

Note that we have only displayed a few of the turbine columns - there are 100 
turbine columns altogether (t1, ..., t100).


### Density Weighted Proportion (`DWP`)
The density-weighted proportion (`DWP`) is the expected fraction of carcasses
that fell in the searched area. Carcass density is not the same at all distances
from a turbine, but typically rises over a short distance then decreases
eventually to 0. Searches were conducted on roads and pads within a 120 m
radius from all 100 turbines to provide sufficient data with which to model the
change in density with distance and from this, accurately calculate the fraction
of all carcasses that are expected to land on road and pad surrounding each
turbine (density-weighted proportion or DWP). The exact configuration of the
roads and pads differs among turbines, hence the DWP must be calculated for each
turbine. DWPs for bats at each turbine are stored in `data_DWP`, which is a data
frame with a column for turbine name (values must match column names in
`data_SS`); a column of DWP labeled `bat`. In other studies where, for example,
mortality of birds might be of interest, `DWP` would be expected vary with
carcass size or species (e.g., the spatial distributions of bats and large birds
around a turbine would like differ from one another). In that case, each carcass
size class (`large`, `medium`, `small`, `bat`) would have its own column.

```{r}
head(data_DWP)
```

### Carcass Observations (`CO`)
Information about each (non-trial) carcass observed during searches is stored in
`CO_data` which is a data frame with at least 4 columns: carcass ID, the turbine
(or unit) at which it was found, the date it was found and its distance from the
turbine center. In `CO_data` we also have turbine type, species, and species
group variables by which we will later summarize mortality estimates.
```{r}
head(data_CO)
```

### Estimating Searcher Efficiency and Carcass Persistence Parameters
Searcher efficiency and carcass persistence parameters are estimated by fitting
models using functions `pkm` and `cpm` which are patterned after familar R
functions such as `lm` and `glm`. In this relatively simple example, our SE and
CP field trials were conducted for one carcass size (bat) on one type of terrain
(roads and pads) in three seasons (spring, summer, fall). The only potential
predictor variable we have is `Season`, which is entered as a column in both
`data_SE` and `data_CP`.

Searcher efficiency is the probability of detection of a carcass that is present
in the searched area at the time of search. Searcher efficiency typically
decreases with carcass age because older carcasses tend to become harder to find
as they accumulate dust or debris, fall deeper into vegetation, get blown
against objects or into holes, decay, or get partially scavenged. In addition,
carcasses missed in one search tend to be more likely to be missed in subsequent
searches because the easy-to-find carcasses are preferentially removed in the
first searches after carcass arrival, leaving mostly the harder-to-find
carcasses available in subsequences searches. GenEst accounts for a non-constant
searcher efficiency using two parameters, `p` (searcher efficiency on the first
search after carcass arrivals) and `k` (proportional change in searcher
efficiency with each successive search). The `k` parameter can be estimated from
field trials if carcasses that are not discovered in the first search after
arrival are left in the field for possible discovery in later searches.

`p` and `k` may both depend on covariates such as season, visibility class, or
carcass size, and GenEst allows for them to be modeled as functions of different
covariate combinations.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?pkm
```
```{r}
model_SE <- pkm(p ~ Season, k ~ 1, data = data_SE)
model_SE
```

NOTE: The `pkm` family of functions by default interprets columns with names
that begin with and "s" or "S" and end with a number contain search results data
(carcass found = 0, not found = 1). A user can override the auto-parsing by
explicitly listing the names of the search data columns in a vector of character
strings in the `obsCol` argument.

The probability of a carcass persisting a given length of time with being
removed by scavengers (or other factors) is modeled as a Weibull, lognormal,
loglogistic, or exponential distribution. Like the `p` and `k` parameters for
searcher efficiency, the location and scale parameters (Therneau 2015) of the
persistence distribution may depend on covariates. GenEst allows for them to be
modeled as separate functions combinations.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?cpm
```
```{r}
model_CP <- cpm(l ~ Season, s ~ Season, data = data_CP, dist = "weibull",
  left = "LastPresent", right = "FirstAbsent")
model_CP
```

In other scenarios we might consider other predictors like visibility of the
ground searched or search team. We might also be interested in carcasses of
different sizes (e.g., large, medium, and small birds instead of or in addition
to bats). We are not restricted to using the same predictors of both SE and CP.
The modeling complexity increases with each additional predictor, but, in
theory, any number of predictors can be used. The only rule is that sufficient
numbers of trial carcasses must be placed in each cell combination of factor
levels among the selected predictors. For example, if we were to place 15
carcasses for each cell for predictors that include season (spring, summer,
fall, winter), size (S, M, L, B), visibility (RP, M, D), search team (dogs,
humans), and turbine type (small, medium, large), we'd need
15 x 4 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 2880 carcasses. Typically, the number of predictors is
limited to a few key variables.

### Mortality Estimation
Each carcass's contribution to the total mortality in each search interval is
estimated using the `estM` function.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?estM
```
```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
Mhat <- estM(nsim = 1000, data_CO = data_CO, data_SS = data_SS,
  data_DWP = data_DWP, model_SE = model_SE, model_CP = model_CP,
  unitCol = "Turbine", dateFoundCol = "DateFound")

summary(Mhat)
plot(Mhat)
```

Mortality estimates may be partitioned or split into desired categories, such as
species, season, or unit. Splits may be performed according to characteristics
of the carcasses or where they were found (e.g., species, turbine or other
variable found in `data_CO`) or when they were found (e.g., season or other
variable associated with search schedule and found in ``data_SS``, or a vector of
specific times).


```{r, eval = FALSE}
?calcSplits
```

Species (a CO split because it is a column in the CO file):
```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
M_species <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj, split_CO = "Species",
  data_CO = data_CO)
summary(M_species)
plot(M_species)
```

Mortality estimates may also be split by temporal variables that are represented
as columns in ``data_SS`` or as numeric vectors spanning the monitoring
season (from day 0 to length of monitoring season). If several temporal splits
are to be calculated, creating a specially formatted ``prepSS`` object for the
search schedule can streamline the calculations.
```{r}
SSdat <- prepSS(data_SS)
```

Season (a SS split because it is a column in the SS file):
```{r Season Split, fig.width = 6.5, fig.height = 5.25, fig.align = 'center'}
M_season <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_SS = "Season", data_SS = SSdat, split_CO = NULL,  data_CO = data_CO)
summary(M_season)
plot(M_season)
```

Month (a temporal split that spans the monitoring period):
```{r Temporal Split, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
M_month <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_time = seq(0, max(SSdat$days), by = 28),
  data_SS = SSdat, data_CO = data_CO)
summary(M_month)
plot(M_month)
```
Temporal splits that divide the monitoring season into separate time intervals
(like season or month) can be plotted as the number per interval
(`rate = FALSE`, which is the default arg in `calcSplits`) or the number per
unit time (`rate = TRUE`).
```{r Time unit Split, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
M_various_times <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_time = c(seq(0, 90, by = 15), 120, 150, seq(155, 200, by = 5)),
  data_SS = SSdat, data_CO = data_CO)
plot(M_various_times)
plot(M_various_times, rate = TRUE)
```

Finally, splits can be calculated for combinations of splitting covariates,
like species by season or species group by turbine type. No more than two
splitting covariates may be used in one call to `calcSplits` and at most one
temporal split may be used (whether it is an SS split or a vector of times).

```{r Species and Season, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center'}
M_species_by_season <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_CO = "Species", data_CO = data_CO,
  split_SS = "Season", data_SS = SSdat)
plot(M_species_by_season)
```

## Example 2: Estimating Bird and Bat Mortality from Searches on Varied Ground
Thorough searches out to a radius of 60 m from each turbine were conducted at 23
out of 100 turbines. The searched area was divided into three visibility classes
(`RP`, `M`, `D`) according the difficulty of finding carcasses.

Searcher efficiency and carcass persistence would be expected to vary with
carcass size (sparrow, eagle, bat), ground characteristics (road & pad,
cleared field, vegetation type), season, etc. In this example, we perform a full
analysis of scenario with four classes of carcass (`lrg`, `med`, `sml`, and
`bat`), three visibility classes (difficult = `D`,  moderate = `M`, and road &
pad = `RP`), and three seasons (`spring`, `summer`, and `fall`).

The required data is stored in `wind_cleared`, a list of data frames with results
for searcher efficiency (`SE`) and carcass persistence trials (`CP`), search
schedules for all turbines (`SS`), the search coverage or density weighted
proportion (`DWP`) of area searched at each turbine (i.e., the fraction of
carcasses expected to fall in the search plots), and carcass observation (`CO`)
data.

Load the full data set into R:
```{r}
data(wind_cleared)
names(wind_cleared)
```
To streamline the notation, extract the data from the `wind_cleared` list into
its components:
```{r}
data_SE <- wind_cleared$SE
data_CP <- wind_cleared$CP
data_SS <- wind_cleared$SS
data_DWP <- wind_cleared$DWP
data_CO <- wind_cleared$CO
```
### Searcher Efficiency and Carcass Persistence Trials
In searcher efficiency and carcass persistence trials, 15 carcasses trial
carcasses were placed in each combination of visibility class (`D`, `M`, `RP`),
season (`spring`, `summer`, `fall`), and size class (`lrg`, `med`, `sml`,
`bat`). Data formats are like those of example 1:
```{r}
head(data_SE)
head(data_CP)
```

### Searcher Efficiency Modeling
With 36 combinations of covariate levels (3 visibilities x 3 seasons x 4 sizes)
and two parameters (`p` and `k`), the number of possible models to consider for
searcher efficiency is unwieldy using the simple `pkm` function, which fits only
one model at a time. 

`pkmSet` is a wrapper function for `pkm` that fits a set of submodels of the
given covariate combination, including the full model, the null model, and
everything in between. For example, if the parameter models are
`p ~ Visibility * Season` and `k ~ Visibility`, `pkmSet` would fit all
combinations of possible `p` models (`p ~ Visibility * Season`,
`p ~ Visibility + Season`, `p ~ Visibility`, `p ~ Season`, and `p ~ 1`) with
possible `k` models (`k ~ Visibility` and `k ~ 1`), or 10 models in all.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?pkm
?pkmSet
```
`cpmSet` does not distinguish between carcass size classes and should be used
with caution when analyzing data sets with multiple size classes. For example,
to model searcher efficiency for small birds, `pkmSet` can be called with `data`
subsetted to include only the small carcasses:

```{r}
SEsml <- data_SE[data_SE$Size == "sml", ]
pkSet_sml <- pkmSet(p ~ Visibility * Season, k ~ Visibility * Season,
  data = SEsml)
names(pkSet_sml)
```
One model must be selected from the long list of models fit. GenEst provides
several tools for guiding the selection. First, the models can be listed by
AICc, which gives a score for the quality of the model for the given data.
Complicated models that use many parameters may fit the data more closely than
a simpler model but are penalized because of their complexity and relative
instability. The scores have meaning only in comparison with other models'.
AICc provides a rough but useful guide for model selection, but should in no way
be relied upon as definitive. Its utility is in identifying relatively poor
models and in narrowing the choice of plausible models to a manageable number.

The `pkmSetAICcTab` function lists the fitted models in order of
${\small \Delta}$AICc.

```{r}
pkmSetAICcTab(pkSet_sml)
```
When AICc differences exceed 6 or 7, preference should normally be given to the
models with the lower scores. Models with differences of less than 3 or 4 are
generally considered indistinguishable by this measure. Choices among such
models should be based on other criteria.

Diagnostic plots can be used to identify potential problems with model fits and
to help distinguish between models with similar AICc scores. The `plot` function
is defined for the `pkmSet` class, and by default, creates a new plot window on
command for each sub-model. To plot a specific single model from the full set,
use the `specificModel` argument. For example, diagnostic plots for the model
with the lowest AICc score are shown below:

```{r, eval = F, fig.show = "hold", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
plot(pkSet_sml, specificModel = "p ~ Visibility; k ~ 1")
```

The top row shows box plots of estimated `p` and `k` parameters for all cells
(i.e., combinations of covariate levels, like `D.fall` for difficult visibility
in the fall) for both the selected model (black) and the full model (gray). With
the full model, the fits for each cell are based solely on data from that
specific cell. The advantage is that each cell's estimates are untainted by data
from other cells. The disadvantage is that the sample size for each estimate
is relatively small and the error bars large. In the reduced models, estimates
for one cell borrow strength from estimates in related cells. This gives smaller
error bars but can lead to errors if the model structure does not properly
reflect the dependence of searcher efficiency parameters on cell
characteristics.

In the figure, the estimates of `p` from the selected model are markedly less
variable than the estimates from the full model, while the locations of the
boxes are very similar for the two models. Thus, this selected model (the one
with the lowest AICc) is a clear improvement over the full cell model for
estimating `p`.

However, the boxplots for `k` indicate a problem with the fit. In particular,
in most of the cells, the boxes extend from 0 to 1, which suggests that the
selected model is unable to estimate `k` for the given cell. Selecting a simpler
model for `k` often remedies this problem.

In this example, the second best model in terms of AICc
(`p ~ Visibility; k ~ 1`, with ${\small \Delta}$AICc = 1.596) is able to succesfully
estimate `k` while still providing a good fit for `p`.

```{r, eval = F, fig.show = "hold", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
plot(pkSet_sml, specificModel = "p ~ Visibility; k ~ 1")
```

By comparison, the model with the highest ${\small \Delta}$AICc (= 41.5) has \
routinely estimates `p` and `k` either well above or well below the full cell
model but has fairly tight error bars--bad estimates but quite confident about
them!

```{r, eval = F, fig.show = "hold", fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7}
plot(pkSet_sml, specificModel = "p ~ Season; k ~ Season")
```

A similar model selection exercise gives the same form of model
(`p ~ Visibility; k ~ 1`) for large birds, medium birds, and bats. These can all
be collated into a list for later analysis of detection probabilities and
mortality rates.

```{r}
pk_med <- pkm(p ~ Visibility, k ~ 1, data = data_SE[data_SE$Size == "med", ])
pk_lrg <- pkm(p ~ Visibility, k ~ 1, data = data_SE[data_SE$Size == "lrg", ])
pk_bat <- pkm(p ~ Visibility, k ~ 1, data = data_SE[data_SE$Size == "bat", ])

pkMods <- list(
  sml = pkSet_sml[["p ~ Visibility; k ~ 1"]],
  med = pk_med,
  lrg = pk_lrg,
  bat = pk_bat
)
```

GenEst also has a wrapper function for `pkModSet` so that different size classes
can be considered in bulk at one time. Read more about it:

```{r, eval = F}
? pkmSetSize
vignette("command-line-example", package = "GenEst")
```

### Carcass Persistence Modeling
The work flow for carcass persistence modeling is similar to that for searcher
efficiency except that in addition to selecting covariates for two different
parameters (location = `l` and scale = `s`), there are four model forms to
choose from: Weibull, lognormal, loglogistic, and exponential. 

```{r, eval = F}
? cpm
? cpmSet
```
```{r}
cpSet_sml <- cpmSet(
  l ~ Visibility * Season, s ~ Visibility * Season,
  data = data_CP[data_CP$Size == "sml", ], left = "LastPresent", right = "FirstAbsent",
  dists = c( "weibull", "lognormal", "loglogistic", "exponential")
)
```
The list of models is long:
```{r}
cpmSetAICcTab(cpSet_sml)
```
It is not uncommon to see the fits for the exponential distribution at the
bottom of the AIC list. The exponential distribution has only one parameter and
does not have nearly as much flexibility as the others, which each have
two-parameters. An implicit assumption of the exponential model is that the
scavenging rate is constant, regardless of carcass age. When that assumption is
not met, the exponential provides an inferior fit. 

To compare among a set of cp models with plausible AICs, use `plot(cpSet, ...)`
with desired models specified by name. It can be seen from the AICc table
(`cpmSetAICcTab(cpSet_sml)`) that the top 10 models according to AICc are:

```{r}
cp_smlCandidates <- names(cpSet_sml)[c(24, 19, 14, 9, 25, 17, 20, 22, 15, 44)]
cp_smlCandidates
```

These can be compared in graphs as follows:

```{r, eval = F}
plot(cpSet_sml, specificModel = cp_smlCandidates)
```

The figure shows the raw persistence data (fraction of carcasses remaining after
the given time) for each cell, as a black stair case with Kaplan-Meier
confidence intervals as dashed lines. In addition, the fitted curves for each of
the distributions are shown in color, with the `specificModel` distribution
having a thicker than the others. The two-parameter models (Weibull, lognormal,
and loglogistic) tend to be very similar and a relatively close fit to the data.
The exponential model tends to be somewhat removed from the others. Clicking on
the graphing window brings up the next set of figures.

We're looking for a good fit between the selected model and the data in as many
cells as possible. The first several models among the `cp_smlCandidates` seems
to provide a reasonably good fit in all cells, although there seems to be a
trade-off between fitting the RP.spring cell well or fitting the RP.summer cell
well. `Visibility` occurs frequently in the top models, while `Season` appears
more frequently in the bottom models. This indicates that `Season` is probably
not a strong predictor of carcass persistence, while `Visibility` is.

Selecting the top AICc model for use in mortality estimation:
```{r}
cp_sml <- cpSet_sml[[cp_smlCandidates[1]]]
```

Following a similar model selection process for the other size classes, we
select the following:

```{r}
cp_med <- cpm(l ~ Visibility, s ~ Season,
  data = data_CP[data_CP$Size == "med", ], left = "LastPresent", right = "FirstAbsent",
  dist = "weibull")
cp_lrg <- cpm(l ~ Visibility + Season, data = data_CP[data_CP$Size == "lrg", ],
  left = "LastPresent", right = "FirstAbsent", dist = "exponential")
cp_bat <- cpm(l ~ Visibility + Season, s ~ 1,
  data = data_CP[data_CP$Size == "med", ], left = "LastPresent", right = "FirstAbsent",
  dist = "weibull")
```

NOTE: For large carcasses, the exponential distribution was at the top of the AICc
list. The exponential requires only one parameter (`l`), so no scale parameter
is provided in the model.

Again, we collate the models into a list for later analysis of detection
probabilities and mortality rates.

```{r}
cpMods <- list(
  sml = cp_sml,
  med = cp_med,
  lrg = cp_lrg,
  bat = cp_bat
)
```

### Mortality Estimation
Each carcass's contribution to the total mortality in each search interval is
estimated using the `estM` function. The function call is largely similar that
used in the simple scenario discussed in example 1. However, there are some
important differences. First, `model_SE` and `model_CP` are lists of models, one
element for each size class. In addition, the name of the size class variable is
provided as `sizeclassCol = "Size"`. Finally, the `frac` argument represents the
sampling fraction or the fraction of carcasses expected to fall at the units
that were searched. In this example, 23 out of 100 turbines were searched, so
`frac` is set equal to 0.23 under the assumption that the mortality rates at the
unsearched turbines did not differ substantially from the rates at the searched
turbines.

```{r Mhat plot, fig.height = 4, fig.width = 7, fig.align = 'center'}
Mhat <- estM(nsim = 1000, data_CO = data_CO, data_SS = data_SS, frac = 0.23,
  data_DWP = data_DWP, model_SE = pkMods, model_CP = cpMods,
  sizeclassCol = "Size", unitCol = "Turbine", dateFoundCol = "DateFound")

summary(Mhat)
plot(Mhat)
```

This estimate is for the total number of fatalities among all size classes
combined, from hummingbirds and bats to eagles. Fortunately, mortality estimates
may be partitioned or split into desired categories, such as species, size, or
season. Splits may be performed according to characteristics
of the carcasses or where they were found (e.g., species, turbine or other
variable found in `data_CO`) or when they were found (e.g., season or other
variable associated with search schedule and found in ``data_SS``, or a vector of
specific times).

Carcasses were categorized not only by size but also by species, species group,
the type of turbine they were found at, the visibility class of the ground
where they were found, and distance from nearest turbine.

Although species groups may extend across different size classes (e.g.,
`raptors` could include kestrels, red-tailed hawks, and golden eagles;
`passerines` could include sparrows and ravens), splits according to species
group can easily be accomplished:

```{r Species Group Plot, , fig.height = 5, fig.width = 5, fig.align = 'center'}
M_speciesGroup <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_CO = "SpeciesGroup",  data_CO = data_CO)
summary(M_speciesGroup)
plot(M_speciesGroup)
```

Split by species and season:
```{r Split Species and Season, fig.height = 12, fig.width = 4, fig.align = 'center'}
M_speciesseason <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_CO = "Species",  data_CO = data_CO, split_SS = "Season", data_SS = data_SS)
summary(M_speciesseason)
plot(M_speciesseason)
```

There are so many vertical panels that it is difficult to glean any useful
information out of the graph. However, the panels may be transposed and graphed
for better interpretability:

```{r Transposed Species Season, fig.height = 7, fig.width = 7, fig.align = 'center'}
plot(transposeSplits(M_speciesseason))
```

Split by size and distance from turbine:
```{r, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center'}
M_distance <- calcSplits(M = Mhat$Mhat, Aj = Mhat$Aj,
  split_CO = c("Distance", "Size"),  data_CO = data_CO)
plot(M_distance)
```
